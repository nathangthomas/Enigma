# Enigma

## Nathan Thomas - Self Assessment

**Overall Score 2.5 - See breakdown below**

### Functionality
 * 2: Below Expectations
 * Enigma#encrypt is not fully functional. Functionality suffers from Enigma#encrypt's inability to handle new lines and skip over/leave punctuation/special characters not included in the alphabet characters in place. Excellent job working with limited outside support to build something from the top down with test driven development. You learned a lot about the application of the seven "P"s (Prior Preparation, Prevents, Piss, Poor, Programming, Performance.) and implications of how decisions made in the planning and design process can have a greater and unattended effects on the implementation of code down the road.

### Object Oriented Programming
* 3: Meets Expectations
* There is some question about your use of number generator in your Enigma class however overall your project is broken into logical components consisting of 4 classes all of which have single responsibilities. You have no more than 2 methods with longer than 7 lines and no class is longer than 100 lines. All variable and method names clearly communicate their purpose. You still have some work to do but it is clear you did what you needed to do to get from Red to Green.  Refactor is your next step here as you can think about ways you can utilize modules.

### Test Driven Development
* 3: Meets Expectations
* It is obvious by your commit history that you are following the principles of TDD and writing tests before code always. Test coverage is 100 %. You do have a non working test at the bottom of your enigma_test file due to improper use of stubbing but overall a great job was done on testing. 

### Version Control
* 3: You have well over 30 commits and exactly 10 pull requests. You made good use of branches and your commit history shows that you were diligent in committing changes as they were being made.
