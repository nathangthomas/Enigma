this is sample code for my enigma machine my enigma machine is able to handle all caps but i was unable to get the function to escape all characters not part of my character set to work i also discovered that it does not work with new lines either while it is unfortunate i did not get this to work fully it was not from a lack of effort and i learned a lot through the process you do not have to be great to start but you have to start to be great the only way to never reach your goals is to never start end
